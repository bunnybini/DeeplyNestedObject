## Moment

On January 1, 2016, the new year began, but more importantly, it was the year I became a middle school student. As a celebration, my family decided to go out, and we ended up going to the new mall that had been built next to the park we used to visit.
I had always wanted a dog since my elementary school days, so we often went to the pet store because of me. That day was no different.
We went to the third floor, where the pet store was located, and saw many puppies taking their nap time. So, we went back to the first floor to explore the rest of the mall. 
After having lunch, I begged my family to go and see the puppies again.
Due to my heartfelt request, my family and I went back up to the third floor to see the puppies awake. 
At that moment, it felt like time had stopped.

I saw a white, fluffy creature running and playing with boundless joy, trying to wake the others up.
It was as if I had found the missing piece of the puzzle I had been searching for. 
Fortunately, I wasn't the only one who felt that way; my family immediately fell in love with the little creature.

We spoke to the staff and asked if we could pet her.
She was small, with dark black eyes and nose, and she looked at us with a curious expression.
I could sense her emotions of fear and nervousness, but I also felt that we were destined to share a strong bond.

After spending some time with her, my family held a "family meeting" to discuss the responsibilities we would have as a family if we brought a dog into our home. 
After two hours of discussion, we decided to bring her home. 

It was the moment I met my love, my best friend, my sister, and half of my soul.....
